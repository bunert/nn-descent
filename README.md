# Nearest Neighbour Descent

This is the repository for the Advanced Systems Lab project by:
- Jonas Bokstaller
- Tobias Buner
- Dan Kluser
- Samuel Rutz

The goal of the project is to implement NN-Descent which is an efficient
algorithm for approximate K-Nearest Neighbour Graph (K-NNG) construction.

The algorithm is described in the pulication "Efficient K-Nearest Neighbor
Graph Construction for Generic Similarity Measures" by Wei Dong et al.
